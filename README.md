# RGB Color Detection Scripts

## Introduction

This repository houses a set of Python scripts that are designed to detect and extract RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) color values from images. There are individual scripts for each color channel detection (`Detection_Red.py`, `Detection_Green.py`, `Detection_Blue.py`) and a comprehensive script (`Detection_RGB.py`) for a full RGB color analysis.

## Features

- Modular color detection with individual scripts for Red, Green, and Blue channels.
- Integrated RGB detection for a combined color analysis.
- Example image (`test_image.jpg`) included for quick testing.

Detect the Red color channel:

python Detection_Red.py test_image.jpg

Detect the Green color channel:

python Detection_Green.py test_image.jpg

Detect the Blue color channel:

python Detection_Blue.py test_image.jpg

For full RGB detection:

python Detection_RGB.py test_image.jpg
