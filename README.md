# RGB Color Detection Scripts

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to detect and extract RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values from images. The suite includes individual scripts for each color channel: `Detection_Red.py`, `Detection_Blue.py`, `Detection_Green.py`, and a comprehensive script `Detection_RGB.py` that utilizes all individual detections for a complete RGB extraction.

## Features

- **Modular Color Detection**: Use individual scripts for targeted color detection.
- **Integrated RGB Detection**: Leverage the combined script for full RGB color extraction.
- **Simplified Setup**: Quick installation with an `install` option.

## Installation

To install the scripts, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone [repository-link]
cd [repository-name]
pip install -r requirements.txt
