## Introduction

This repository houses a set of Python scripts that are designed to detect and extract RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) color values from images. There are individual scripts for each color channel detection (`Detection_Red.py`, `Detection_Green.py`, `Detection_Blue.py`) and a comprehensive script (`Detection_RGB.py`) for a full RGB color analysis.

## Features

- Modular color detection with individual scripts for Red, Green, and Blue channels.
- Integrated RGB detection for a combined color analysis.
- Example image (`test_image.jpg`) included for quick testing.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mebin98/Team84_OSSW

Navigate to the cloned repository's directory:
cd Team84-OSSW

## Usage
To detect specific color channels in an image, you should execute the relevant script with the image file as an argument. You can use the 'test_image.jpg' provided in the same directory, or you can replace it with the path to your desired image.

For the Detection:

python Detection_RGB.py

Just place the 'test_image.jpg' in the same directory as the scripts and run the desired detection script.
